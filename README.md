Hi everybody. This is a litte game that I made just for fun.

Controlls: Left and right arrow keys and spacebar to shoot. You can also click on the shop buttons

STEPS TO PLAYING THE GAME:
Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and download the zip
Once that is finished, extract the zip
Next, navigate to the "Game" folder
Select which build you want to play
Then click on "point and shoot" or "Communist Russ" or whatever I name the game. (This one should be the one with the game's icon, not the folders or the other unity stuff)
Now have fun!
